# System Security Checker

A cross-platform desktop application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript for performing system security checks. The main goal is to check system security settings and send the results to a remote server whenever the user wants, without the need to run anything on the background.

## 🚀 Features

- Cross-platform desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Check system security settings as:
  - Screen lock timeout
  - Disk encryption
  - Antivirus status
- Send results to a remote on Supabase

## 📦 Installation

In the release section, you can download the latest version of the application for your operating system. As this code is not signed, you will be prompted by your operating system to avoid running the application.

### MacOS

In MacOS, you can run the application by executing this command:

```bash
xattr -c SystemSecurityChecker.app
```

### Windows

In Windows, the system will advise you to not run the application because it is not signed but you can run it anyway.

### 🖥️ Database structure

Supabase database SQL:

```sql
create table public.security_reports (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  device_id text not null,
  user_email text not null,
  user_full_name text not null,
  disk_encrypted boolean not null,
  encryption_type text null,
  antivirus_detected boolean not null,
  antivirus_name text null,
  screen_lock_active boolean not null,
  screen_lock_time text null,
  operating_system text null,
  os_version text null,
  last_check timestamp without time zone null default now(),
  created_at timestamp without time zone null default now(),
  constraint security_reports_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint security_reports_device_id_key unique (device_id),
  constraint security_reports_user_email_device_id_key unique (user_email, device_id),
  constraint security_reports_user_email_key unique (user_email)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

This is a simple version of the database structure. If the requirements grow, or if you need to have any other fields or constraints, you can add them to the table. Just make sure to keep the constraints about the email and device id, because they should be unique.
